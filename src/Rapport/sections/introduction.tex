\section{introduction}

The goal of the introduction is to let the readers (the professor and TAs) know the topic of your work and the main takeaways of it.
The introduction should be broad enough to understand the document without reading it and specific enough to let the reader know: \textit{If you are interested in this topic, you should read this work}.

In the context of the Web Technologies course, the introduction should clearly describe:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Motivation: what problem does this work try to solve (and why is it important)
    \item Project: clearly describes the topic the group chose to work with
    \item Contributions: main takeaways that readers will get from reading this work
\end{itemize}


Remember to keep this and all other sections within the page and column limits.
It is your responsibility to describe first the most important and interesting aspect of each section.
That way, you can leave behind non-interesting and repeated information more easily.

\myparagraph{Length} Half a column.
