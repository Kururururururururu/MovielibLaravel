\section{Resource Management}

The second task of this project is to build a resource management.
A resource is a model of an object in your system, and it could be anything: movies, music albums, pets, etc.
This section should clearly describe the management of the chosen resource: the CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) operations associated with that resource:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Technically describe the resource (ie, the model)
    \item Technically describe how the CRUD operations are implemented
\end{itemize}

\myparagraph{Resources} Lectures 4 to 6.

\myparagraph{Length} 2 columns.
