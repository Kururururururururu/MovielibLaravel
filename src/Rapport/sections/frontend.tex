\begin{itemize}
    \item Technically describe the use of HTML 5: which HTML tags do you use, where, and why
    \item Technically describe the use of CSS: why and how you use CSS (including interesting selectors/declarations and how it is incorporated in the application)
    \item Technically describe the use of JavaScript: why and how you use it in your application (including interesting behaviors and how they are incorporated into the application)
\end{itemize}
