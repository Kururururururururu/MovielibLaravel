\section{Introduction}

Our group has developed a movie library that acts as an independent service in which users can get an overview of a broad range of existing movies. The movie library enables users to create a watchlist and keep an overview of the added movies. Further, the web service features a rating system allowing users to rate movies with 1-5 stars. Additionally, a public comment section is available. Thus, allowing users to make comments, which can be read by others.\newline
The movie library differentiates it's watchlist system from existing streaming services by providing access to a wider collection of movies. Thereby, creating an online environment in which users can create a collected overview. \newline
