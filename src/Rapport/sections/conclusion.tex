\section{Conclusion}

The goal of the conclusion is similar to the introduction: it summarizes the work itself and the takeaways a reader should take when reading this work. However, it can use the information presented in the work to be more specific than the introduction.

In the context of the Web Technologies course, the conclusion should clearly describe:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Summary: summary of the work and main takeaways. Also include a class diagram of the system (the models).
    \item Future Work: interesting directions on how the presented work can evolve in the future (it may be the starting point to choose individual extension topics)
\end{itemize}

\myparagraph{Length} Half a column.
