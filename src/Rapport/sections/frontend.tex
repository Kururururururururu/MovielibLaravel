\section{Front-end}


We have developed the front-end of the application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
However, Blade templates have also been used since we are working with Laravel which is a framework that incorporates them.
Blade allows you to use PHP within your HTML, which can be very handy in order to display data from APIs, databases or other sources.\newline

\textbf{HTML 5:} \newline
HTML 5 is the most recent version of HTML, This version introduces some new semantic tags.
Semantic tags can enhance accessibility and SEO.
Also, they make it easier for developers to understand page structure as well as the purpose of each section.
For example, \textless{}header\textgreater{}, \textless{}nav\textgreater{}, \textless{}main\textgreater{}, and \textless{}footer\textgreater{} among others have been used to define our pages’ header, navigation bar, and footer.\newline

In our project, we tried to utilize these semantic tags as best as possible in order to identify different sections on the page.
These include movie information and comments when viewing a specific movie on its own page.
This makes it easy to understand each section’s purpose by giving an overview of how each section has been divided into.
Using more descriptive markup such as the \textless{}section\textgreater{} instead of generic \textless{}div\textgreater{} tags provides more meaningful semantics.\newline

\textbf{CSS:} \newline
CSS is used for setting up the style and visuals of the HTML page elements,
and these define features such as the layout, colors, and fonts as well as the overall page structure.
It improves the visual appearance and can also make it user-friendly with things like animations on hover, transitions or a number of other CSS3 capabilities that may indicate to a user that an element can be clicked.\newline

In our application we did not want to use the default styles that the browser has, so we used CSS to style the page and application to what we wanted.
However, CSS can become difficult to navigate through and maintain.
The reason behind this is, that you never know if a style has been used somewhere else in the application.
This can cause inadvertent changes in other sections of the app which are often hard to debug.
For this reason especially being a group project, which most of the time makes it even more difficult, we had different CSS files for different pages unless they were common components across pages.
So, as far as that problem was concerned we also made sure that descriptive class names were used only along with targeting IDs and classes that were specific to the page.
This way others CSS files would remain unchanged.
There is a downside to doing this, it can lead to a lot of duplicate code, which can also make it hard to maintain, as it is likely that at some point, there will be unused styles in those CSS files.
We weighed the pros and cons of this approach and decided that it was the best approach for our project.\newline

\textbf{JavaScript:} \newline
JavaScript is a programming language that helps make web pages interactive and dynamic. Moreover, it allows for adding or removing elements from the page, changing the styles of elements as well as making API calls.
Since Laravel is a server-side application most of our data are fetched from the server on page load.
But we also have some dynamic elements on the page such as the movies' comment section, which can be 
fetched from the server when a user clicks on the comment button by making an API call to the server, the watchlist button for 
correctly displaying the current state of the movies' existence in a user's watchlist, and rating system used to rate movies from 1 to 5 stars.\newline

The way that JavaScript is incorporated into HTML is by using the \textless{}script\textgreater{} tag. It is not only used for including JavaScript files but can also be used for writing JavaScript code directly in the HTML file.
We have gone with the former approach, because it is less complex to maintain and debug since you can easily see which JavaScript files are included on the page.
Nevertheless, we have also utilized the latter option, but only for minor scripts that are unique to that specific page.\newline
