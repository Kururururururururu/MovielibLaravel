\section{Conclusion}

In this project, we have developed a web application
that is able to display a wide variety of movies and give a quick overview of the movies' information. 
The application also provides a way for authorized users to add comments and ratings to the movies, 
as well as putting them on a watchlist.\newline

The application is built using Laravel, and utilizes a database to store our users, 
watchlist data, and comments. The movies are fetched from TMDB, using their API. \newline

\subsection{Future Work}
Future work on the application could include adding more user types as explained in the authorization section, 
as well as adding better filtration of movies when looking through the list. \newline
